# Introduction
> The project uses Vue.js + Flask + Echarts + DataV to implement all projects
Vue
Vue.js, as a progressive framework that has been developed day by day, can realize data binding and grouping of responses, and use simple APIs to build data-driven web interfaces. Single-page applications can refresh the page locally, without having to request every page jump. All data and dom.
